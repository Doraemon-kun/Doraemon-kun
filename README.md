### AM *(Doraemon-kun)*
#### 📝 Few about me:

Hello everyone, I'm AM, a very normal high school students but do love coding, configuring and doing things on my own.
I learnt to code since I was in elementary school, because It's fun, and have a lot of challenges.

At this time I'm still just a normal coding learner, but I will try to learn more and be a pretty code-proficient person later on. 

*(I'm not going to be a developer.... actually)*

#### 😄 Pronouns: AM or DoraKun

#### 🌱 I’m currently learning: 

Python (Object-Oriented Programming), C++ and Dynamic Programming

#### ⚡ Fun fact:

I love watching Anime, and have my anime/manga list at [AniList](https://anilist.co/user/DoraKun/). Also the profile picture is [Kaori Fujimiya](https://anilist.co/character/88037/Kaori-Fujimiya) from Isshuukan Friends, one of my favorite anime series of all time. Really love this one and looking forward to catching up with its sequel manga series.
